/**
 * Utilities to convert arbitrary strings to values of the various
 * Safe HTML types, subject to security review. These are also referred to as
 * "reviewed conversions".
 *
 * These functions are intended for use-cases that cannot be expressed using an
 * existing safe API (such as a type's builder) and instead require custom code
 * to produce values of a Safe HTML type. A security review is required to
 * verify that the custom code is indeed guaranteed to produce values that
 * satisfy the target type's security contract.
 *
 * Code using restricted conversions should be structured such that this
 * property is straightforward to establish. In particular, correctness should
 * only depend on the code immediately surrounding the reviewed conversion, and
 * not on assumptions about values received from outside the enclosing function
 * (or, at the most, the enclosing file).
